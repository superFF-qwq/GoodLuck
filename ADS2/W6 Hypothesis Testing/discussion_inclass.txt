problem
sample size
data source
sample size is too small
the figure and the interpretion of does not match:
figure 1 talked about kg, but the interpretion talked about percentage.
Figure 4: The biggest problem!
so many comparisons
just one or two significant -> they write this paper
no testing correction!
